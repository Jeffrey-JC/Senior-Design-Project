# Senior-Design-Project
A project consisting of a Raspberry Pi, solar cells, and INA219 current sensors that test the efficiency of solar cells.
When the program runs, the solar cells will collect data from the detected solar energy and store it into a text file.
After the program is finished running, the values of current (Amps) on each solar cell will be displayed on an organized text file and on a visual graph.
